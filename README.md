# ProjectEuler
My solutions for project Euler's problems.
The solutions aren't the best out there, they are just my approach at them.
The name of each folder refers to the questions on projecteuler.net and the readme file inside each of those contains the problem itself while the script present in there is the solution.
I'll try to adress any issues found.
